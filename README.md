### What does it do:

Searching for a new aparment is the worst. It's hard to find if an apartment building is really a good fit just by taking a tour and speeking with the leasing office. This app matches potential renter's / buyers with current tennets. This allow's the potential renter or buyer get the honest truth about the building and ask any questions they may have to current tennets. Similar to facebook's marketplace both current and potential occupents will be able ask questions, write reviews, or schedule phone or video chat's offline or in the app.
